# pickle-console 0.0.1

A simple console for toddlers that connects to HTML5 based web interface via websockets. The console hardware is build around an Onion Omega2 and uses three clicky arcade style buttons for interaction. The aim is to make simple, short, educational mini games each lasting about 20 seconds teaching letter, counting, and colours. At the moment a lot of the games are based on canvas and d3.js because that is what I am familiar with, but the plan to start experimenting with matter.js eventually. 


## Hardware requirements
* Omega Onion2
* 3 Arcade switches
* some wood

## Software requirements
